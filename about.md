## Roots

Born and raised a midst the rugged beauty of the high shrub steppe of Eastern Washington, I inherited a spirit of curiosity and a thirst for knowledge that would shape my life's trajectory.

As the eldest of three siblings on a hobby ranch, I was immersed in a rich tapestry of experiences from an early age. Surrounded by parents who instilled in me the love for reading, I found myself navigating diverse landscapes - from the intricate workings of computers to the nuances of livestock management; from the thrill of horseback riding to the discipline of marksmanship; from the intricacies of international affairs to the serenity of pastoral life.

My quest for knowledge led me to Prairie Bible College in Alberta, Canada, where I encountered not only a calling to ministry but also the love of my life. Four years later, with a degree in hand and a heart full of dreams, I embarked on the adventure of marriage and settled in the vibrant community of Tri-Cities, Washington.

## Professional Evolution

Fueled by a desire to merge my technological acumen with real-world applications, I found myself at Ranch & Home, a local farm and feed supply store, where my journey into the realms of technology and community engagement truly began. From humble beginnings as a cashier, I ascended the ranks, honing my skills as a primary technology support specialist and social media manager.

Eager to broaden my horizons, I seized an opportunity at Amazon.com, providing technical support for their Kindle Reader. This stint not only enriched my expertise but also ignited a passion for the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity.

My journey took another turn as I assumed the role of IT Manager at Bethel Church, overseeing a diverse network of users spanning multiple locations and operating systems. Today, I am the Network Administrator for an employee owned Architecture and Engineering firm, contributing my expertise to an environment where innovation meets excellence.

With over a decade of experience in the ever-evolving realm of IT, I stand as an aspiring cybersecurity professional, driven by a profound fascination with technology and its ethical implications. My journey is not merely confined to the realm of technology; it extends to a deep-rooted commitment to community involvement, cultural exploration, and sustainable living.

## Passions

From the hum of computers to the whisper of the wind in distant lands, my interests span a diverse spectrum - from Cybersecurity to Cultural Exploration; from Linux to Lisp; from Drone Flying to Stargazing. Each pursuit reflects not only my passion for discovery but also my unwavering dedication to shaping a future where technology serves as a catalyst for positive change.

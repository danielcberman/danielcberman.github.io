We have been supporting a young boy, named Nirob from Bangladesh for the last seven years through World Vision. We had the honor and privilege of meeting him today, for the first time in person. He's bright, caring and wants to be a doctor some day. I couldn't be more proud. So many reasons to pray for him and his family.

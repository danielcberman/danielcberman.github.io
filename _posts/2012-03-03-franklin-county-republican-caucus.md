I participated in the Franklin County Republican caucus this morning for the very first time in my life. It was fascinating to see the formation of ideas and policies that are at-least supposed to eventually end up in Washington DC. I still have my doubts, but I was impressed in a new way just how much freedom we have been granted in this country to even meet to even discuss issues of law, government, business and the freedom(s) to live life in an organized fashion. We have so much to be thankful for.

One of the interesting things I noted was the members of my precinct that attended. The precinct is about 10-15 blocks by 10-15 blocks square. People who atleast in one point in time would be the normal pool of people that your friends and neighbors came from. I didn't know of any of them despite living in the Mid-Columbia Region for over 25 years. In yet because of a Franklin county political caucus I had the opportunity to meet new people, and get out my comfort zone.

I know some people reading this may not agree with my political views, but its not just about the politics. Do you know your neighbors? Do you thank God everyday for the freedoms which we have in this country, and then pray for those people who don't? Are you availing yourself of opportunities to be involved in your government, and if not why not? Are you happy with the priorities that the answer to the previous question just told you about yourself?

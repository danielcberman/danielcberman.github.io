Almost a year ago I came across Dan Slimmon's Post about [Do-Nothing Scripting](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/). One of the critical reasons for writing "Do Nothing" scripts is that it forces you to enumerate and thus document your process(es). This opens the doors to eventually automating your process but until that occurs at least you have an electronic version of a checklist helping you keep your place when the inevitable phone call or interruption occurs.

Working at [Bethel](https://www.bethel.ch) I was responsible for 150+ employees and 150+ devices and numerous processes in a mixed Mac OS, and Windows environment. Unfortunately I fell into the trap of doing almost everything by hand, instead of automating with extreme prejudice. Now at [Meier](http://meierinc.com/) I have had the chance to start working through John Savill's [Power Shell Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nFq_hR7FcMYg32xsSAObuq8) which I highly recommend for solid depth while being readily accessible. 

Check out my take on a [Do-Nothing Script](https://github.com/danielcberman/sysadmin-powershell/blob/master/do-nothing-script.ps1) implemented in PowerShell.

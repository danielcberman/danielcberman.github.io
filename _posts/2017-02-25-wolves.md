![Letter from Thomas Jefferson](/assets/thomas-jefferson-letter.jpg)

This image is a selection from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson, To Edward Carrington Paris, on Jan. 16, 1787

No matter if you are on the left or right, I would suggest that the people of the USA are responsible for the government we have. Will we change our ways, about not caring what goes on in government or even complaining about government policy but failing to get involved whenever possible? All this stuff happens off of Facebook folks. Protests are not the answer Facebook rants are not the answer.

Rather staying informed, asking for and showing up at town hall meetings, participating in local government, and especially voting in every single election where you have a right to vote. There are things we will disagree on and should have discussions about but let's seek common ground wherever possible.
